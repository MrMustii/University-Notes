(*) It suffices to construct a special model M€, whose states correspond to maximal K,-consistent sets (denoted by V'), and show that: (M€,50) b= piff o € V (%) Why is it enough? Because if we knew that (**) is true we would get (*): By Lindenbaum Lemma, if ¢ is K,-consistent then ¢ is contained in some maximal Kj,-consistent set V. From (**) it follows that (M€, sv) = ¢, and so ¢ is satisfiable in MC. Hence, @ is satisfiable wrt M,,.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
