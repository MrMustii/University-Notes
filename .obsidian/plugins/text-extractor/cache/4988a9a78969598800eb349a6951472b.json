Real networks evolve over rather different time scales: World Wide Web ‘The first webpage was created in 1991. Given its trillion documents, the WWW added a node each ‘millisecond (103 sec). Cell ‘The cell is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. With roughly 20,000 genes in a human cell, on. average the cellular network added a node every 200,000 years (~10\"3 sec). Given these enormous time-scale differences it is impossible to use real time to compare the dynamics of different networks. Therefore, in network theory we use event time, advancing our time-step by one each time when there is a change in the network topology. For example, in the Barabdsi-Albert model the addition of each new node corresponds to a new time step, hence t=N. In other models time is also advanced by the arrival of a new link or the deletion of a node. If needed, we can establish a direct mapping between event time and the physical time.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
