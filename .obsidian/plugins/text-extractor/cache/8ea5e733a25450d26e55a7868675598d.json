Then for some u, M, u |= . Take any t, such that (s,t) € K;. Since K is symmetric we have (t,s) € K; and since it is also transitive we get that (t,u) € K;. Thus is follows that M., t |= =Kjp (by the semantics of K). Since this is true for all t, such that (s, t) € K; (again by the semantics of K) we obtain M, s = Ki—=Kip, and so we conclude = —Kip — Ki—Kip. O","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
