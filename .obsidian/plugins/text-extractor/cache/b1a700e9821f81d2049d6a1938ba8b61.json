The figure shows the first four steps of the network’s evolution for m=1 64(%: We start with an empty network. 64: The first node can only link to itself, forming a self- loop. Self-loops are allowed, and so are multi-links for m>1. 642 Node 2 can either connect to node 1 with probability 2/3, or to itself with probability 1/3. According 10 (5.2), half of the links that the new node 2 brings along is already counted as present. Consequently node 1 has degree k=2 at node 2 has degree k=1, the normalization constant being 3. 64 Let us assume that the first of the two G;(® network possibilities have materialized. When node 3 comes along, it again has three choices: It can connect to node 2 with probability 1/5, to node 1 with probability 3/5 and 1o itself with probability 1/5. [ m<a = ifA<i<t-1 - =% N (3] F=U That is, we place a link from the new node v, to node v; with probability ky/(2t-1), where the new link already contributes to the degree of v,. Consequently node v, can also link to itself with probability 1/(2t - 1), the second term in (5.2). Note also that the model permits self-loops and multi-links. Yet, their number becomes negligible in the t— limit. For m >1we build Gn® by adding m links from the new node v; one by one, in each step allowing the outward half of the newly added link to contribute to the degrees.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
