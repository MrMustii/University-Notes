In this language Erdés and Rényi discovered that as we vary z, key properties of random graphs appear quite suddenly A graph has a given property Q if the probability of having Q approaches 1as N — w. That is, for a given z either almost every graph has the property Q or almost no graph has it. For example, for z less than ~3/2 almost all graphs contain only isolated nodes and pairs of nodes connected by a link. Once z exceeds -3/2, most networks will contain paths connecting three or more nodes (Image 3.8). p-N' 2| - 2 a2 4 2 K 203 - Evolution of a Random Graph The threshold probabilities at which different subgraphs appear in a random graph, as defined by the exponent z in the p(N) ~ N relationship. For z <-3/2 the graph consists of isolated nodes and edges. When z passes -3/2 trees of order 3 appear, while at z = -4/3 trees of order 4 appear. At z = 1 trees of all orders are present, together with cycles of all orders. Complete subgraphs of order 4 appear at z =-2/3, and as z increases further, complete subgraphs of larger and larger order emerge. After [19].","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
