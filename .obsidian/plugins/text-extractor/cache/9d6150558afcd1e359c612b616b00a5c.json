We show that one of F U {¢} and F U {—p} is AX-consistent. For assume to the contrary that neither of them is AX-consistent. It is not hard to see that F U {¢ V —p} is then also not AX-consistent. So F is not AX-consistent, because ¢V~ is a propositional tautology. This gives a contradiction. If FU{p} is AX-consistent, then we must have ¢ € F since F is a maximal AX-consistent set. Similarly, if F U {—¢} is AX-consistent then = € F. Thus, one of ¢ or —p isin F. It is clear that we cannot have both ¢ and —¢ in F, for otherwise F would not be AX-consistent.
