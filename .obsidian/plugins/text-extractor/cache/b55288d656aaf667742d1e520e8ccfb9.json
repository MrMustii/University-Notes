Induction hypothesis: Assume that for all £ < k, M, = ¢. We have to show that then ¢ (= ¢x) is valid in M. 1. ¢ is a propositional tautology or axiom A2 are as in the base case. 2. ¢ was obtained by an application of a rule of K, to the previous steps: 2.1 ¢ was obtained by applying R1, i.e., thereis a v € £, and i,j < k, such that i # j, @i = v and @ =y — ¢. By the induction hypothesis, we know that then v and v — ¢ are valid in M,, i.e., true in all worlds in all possible-world models in M. Then in all those worlds, also ¢ is true, by the semantics of —. So, M, |= ¢. 2.2 ¢ was obtained by applying R2, i.e., thereisa vy € L, and j < k, p; = and ¢ = Kj~, for some i € {1,...,n}. By the induction hypothesis M, |= . As we have shown in Lecture 3: Validities of Epistemic Logic, then M, |= Kiv, and so M, |= . Thus, for any formula ¢ € L,, if Ko ¢, then M, = ¢.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
