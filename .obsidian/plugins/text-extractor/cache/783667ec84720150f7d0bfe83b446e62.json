Hence for these in the N — « limit the first moment (k) is finite, but the second and higher moments, k\"), ¢k3), go to infinity. This divergence helps us understand the origin of the “scale-free” term. Indeed, if the degrees follow a normal distribution, then the degree of a randomly chosen node is typically in the range Yet, the average degree <k> and the standard deviation o} have rather different magnitude in random and in scale-free networks: + Random Networks Have a Scale For a random network with a Poisson degree distribution oy = <k> 1/ 2, which is always smaller than (k). Hence the network’s nodes have degrees in the range k = (k) + (k)‘/ 2. In other words nodes in a random network have comparable degrees and the average degree (k) serves as the “scale” of a random network. « Scale-free Networks Lack a Scale For a network with a power-law degree distribution with y < 3 the first moment is finite but the second moment is infinite. The divergence of (k?)(and of o}) for large N indicates that the fluctuations around the average can be arbitrary large. This means that when we randomly choose a node, we do not know what to expect: The selected node’s degree could be tiny or arbitrarily large. Hence networks with y < 3 do not have a meaningful internal scale, but are “scale-free” (Image 4.7). For example the average degree of the WWW sample is (k)= 4.60 (Table 4.1). Given thaty = 2.1, the second moment diverges, which means that our expectation for the in-degree of a randomly chosen WWW document is k=4.60 + ® in the N — « limit. That is, a randomly chosen web document could easily yield a document of degree one or two, as 74.02% of nodes have in-degree less than (k). Yet, it could also yield a node with hundreds of millions of links, like google.com or facebook.com.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
