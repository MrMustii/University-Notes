Then ¢ is (a substitution of) an axiom of K,. There are two cases: 1. ¢ is (a substitution of) a propositional tautology. In this case ¢ is true under any propositional valuation, so it is true in all possible worlds of all possible-world models in M, so ¢ is valid in M,,. 2. ¢ is (a substitution of) of the axiom A2: (Kity A Ki(p — 7)) — Kiy, where i € {1,...,n}. We need to show that the above formula is valid wrt M,,. We have done that in Lecture 3: Validities of Epistemic Logic.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
