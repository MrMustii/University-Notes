Let p € £, and K, F . That means that there exists a proof of ¢ in KCy: a sequence of formulas $0 -5 Pho with @, = ¢, such that for all £ € {0,..., k}, ¢ is either (a substitution of) an axiom of KCp, or it is derived from previous steps of the proof by one of the rules of inference of K. We need to show that then M, |= ¢. We will prove that by induction on the length of the proof.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
