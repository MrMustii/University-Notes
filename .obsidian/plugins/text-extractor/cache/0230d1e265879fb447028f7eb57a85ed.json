First consider that it is false, i.e., (M,s) [~ (Kip A Ki(e — ). In that case indeed (M, s) |= (Kip A Ki(p — ) — Ki (by the semantics of —). Now consider that it is true, i.e., (M,s) |= (Kig A Ki(¢ = ¢)). Then (M, s) = Kig and M, s |= Ki(¢ — 1) (by the semantics of A). Then, for all t € S, such that (s, t) € K;, (M, t) = ¢ and (M, t) |= ¢ — 1 (by the semantics of K). So, for all t € S, such that (s, t) € K, (M, t) |= ¢ (by the semantics of —). That means that (M, s) = Kitp (by the semantics of K), and hence that (M, s) |= (Kip A Ki(p = ) = Kih. Since M, i, and s were chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that E (Kig A Ki(p = ¢)) = Ki.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
