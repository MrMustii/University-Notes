This leads to potential mathematical conflicts: If the links are truly independent, they could connect to the same node i, resulting in multi-links. or 2 ‘Bollobas and collaborators [10] proposed the Linearized Chord Diagram (LCD) to resolve these problems, making the model more amenable to ‘mathematical approaches. According to the LCD, for m=1we build a graph G, as follows (Image 5.5) 25 « Start with G1(0), corresponding to an empty graph with no nodes. g « Given G, generate G,¥ by adding the node o 3 veand a single link between v, and v;, where v; is 3 chosen with probability -","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
