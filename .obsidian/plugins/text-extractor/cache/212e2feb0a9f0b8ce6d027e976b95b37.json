Therefore the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree k or smaller, which is the cumulative degree distribution, follows m\\Y/8 P(t)=1- (%) 6-19) By taking the derivative of (5.14) we obtain the degree distribution m m:\"f’:,% =2m2k3 (5.15) ‘which is (5.9).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
