The binomial distribution provides the probability py that we obtain exactly x heads in a sequence of N throws. In general, the binomial distribution describes the number of successes in N independent experiments with two possible outcomes, in which the probability of one outcome is p, and of the other is 1-p. The binomial distribution has the form N = p.:( )r‘(lfp)”’ ! T The mean of the distribution (first moment) is N (z) = X @pz = Np [EX) =) Its second moment is N (a%) = 3 a?p. = p(1 ~p)N +p?N?
