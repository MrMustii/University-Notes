The difference between them is in the degree of a single node. While we can build a simple network using the degree distribution (a), it is impossible to build one using (b), as one stub always remains unmatched. Hence (a) is graphical, while (b) is not. = Fraction of networks, g, for a given y that are graphical. A large number of degree sequences with degree exponent y and N = 10° were generated, testing the graphicality of each network. The figure indicates that while virtually all networks with y » 2 are graphical, it is impossible to find graphical networks in the O <y « 2 range. After [391","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
