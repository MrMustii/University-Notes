Consider any t such that (s, t) € K; and any u such that (t,u) € Kj. Since K; is transitive, we have (s, u) € Ki. Since M, s |= Kip, we get M, u |= ¢ (by the semantics of K). Thus, for all t such that (s, t) € K;, we have M., t |= Kip (by the semantics of K). Finally (again by the semantics of K) we obtain M, s |= K;Kiy, and so we conclude = Kip — KiKip.
