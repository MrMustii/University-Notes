It follows that F itself is AX-consistent. We claim that in fact F is a maximal AX-consistent set. To show this take any ¢ € £ and ¢ & F. Since v is a formula in £, it must appear in our enumeration, say as . If Fi U{vy} were AX-consistent, then our construction would guarantee that 1y € Fiy1, and hence that ¢, € F. Because ¢, = ¢ ¢ F, it follows that F, U {1} is not AX-consistent. Hence F U {#} is also not AX-consistent. It follows that F is a maximal AX-consistent set.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
