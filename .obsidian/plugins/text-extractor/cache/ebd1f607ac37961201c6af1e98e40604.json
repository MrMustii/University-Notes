A degree sequence that can be turned into simple graph (i.e. a graph lacking multi-links or self-loops) is called graphical [35]. Yet, not all degree sequences are graphical: For example, if the number of stubs is odd, then we will always have an unmatched stub (Image 4.14b). The graphicality of a degree sequence can be tested with an algorithm proposed by Erdés and Gallai [35, 36, 37,38, 39]. If we apply the algorithm to scalefree networks we find that the number of graphical degree sequences drops to zero for y < 2 (Image 4.14c). Hence degree distributions with y < 2 cannot be turned into simple networks. Indeed, for networks in this regime the largest hub grows faster than N. If we do not allow self-loops and multi-links, then the largest hub will run out of nodes to connect to once its degree exceeds N-1. a. Graphical b.
